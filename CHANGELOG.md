## [1.0.46] - 2025-05-27

### Fixed

- Fixed issue where GitLab issues and milestones with null descriptions would cause JSON-RPC errors
  - Changed `description` field to be nullable with default empty string in schemas
  - This allows proper handling of GitLab issues/milestones without descriptions
