### Fixed

- Added `expanded` property to `start` and `end` in `GitLabDiscussionNoteSchema`  
  Now you can expand or collapse more information at the start and end of discussion notes.  
  Example: In code review, you can choose to show or hide specific parts of the discussion.  
  (See: [PR #40](https://github.com/zereight/gitlab-mcp/pull/40))
